# rails_env_helper
Simplify working with environment variables in a Ruby on Rails application.
rails_env_helper, is designed to simplify the handling of environment variables in a Ruby on Rails application, particularly in different environments like development, test, and production. It attempts to address a common challenge faced by Rails developers, which involves managing and accessing environment variables in a consistent and convenient way.

In a typical Rails application, developers often need to differentiate how environment variables are accessed based on the application's runtime environment (e.g., development, production). The example gem provides a helper method, RailsEnvHelper.get_env, that abstracts away the complexity of accessing environment variables, making the code cleaner and more Rails-centric.

The specific issue it aims to solve is twofold:

Consistent Handling of Environment Variables: The gem provides a unified method, RailsEnvHelper.get_env, to fetch environment variables. In production, it retrieves the variable directly from ENV, while in non-production environments (e.g., development), it leverages Rails credentials for a more secure and organized approach.

Simplified Code for Environment Variable Access: Developers can use a single method call (RailsEnvHelper.get_env) to access environment variables, regardless of the runtime environment. This reduces the need for conditional checks and allows for more straightforward and readable code.

By addressing these issues, the gem aims to enhance the developer experience when working with environment variables in a Ruby on Rails application, promoting consistency and simplicity in code implementation.
